<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a college opt-out who got into tech sales, now chasing my dream of being a software engineer.</p>

<p>My favorite sports are hockey and baseball. (Go Lightning)</p>

<p>My favorite foods are cheeseburgers and chicken.</p>

<p>Sometimes I want to break my keyboard when learning code, but once it works, nothing beats that dopamine spike.</p>
